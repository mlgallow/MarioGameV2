# MarioGameV2
This is an updated version of the repository MarioGameV1, this version implements polymorphism. This version of the code will include the introduction of coin blocks and coins being able to pop out of the blocks. This also allows Mario to run into the coins and they disapear from the screen, implying him collecting the coins like you would in a normal Mario game.
